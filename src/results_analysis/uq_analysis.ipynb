      "Sentence: Blanco established himself earlier in his career working for Dr. Luke's Kasz Money Productions.\n",
      "Response: 1. The statement doesn't contain clear subjective indicators; it consists of facts, people's names, and past actions without including the author's personal viewpoints, opinions, interpretations, evaluations, or emotional stance.\n",
      "2. At first glance, the objective classification appears plausible since the sentence describes a straightforward historical event (\"established himself\") and a professional association (\"working for\").\n",
      "3. Potential ambiguities could stem from cultural perspectives or prior experiences connected to the mentioned names (\"Blanco\" and \"Dr. Luke\" or \"Kasz Money Productions\"), but in a typical news article or general interest discussion, such nuances should be implicit or irrelevant to the main narrative flow.\n",
      "4. I am quite confident about this classification, although some slight ambiguity may arise when reading it in the overall context of the article or the author's voice if they usually include more interpretive subjective elements throughout their writing.\n",

      "Uncertainty score: 85\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though this statement's classification is likely objective, there exists some uncertainty due to the potential contextual interpretations (e.g., negative associations some readers might have with \"Dr. Luke\" because of public scandals or other reasons). Still, the objective nature of the language in this sentence gives us good cause to assume it is an objective statement.\n",

      "Sentence: RULE 13: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  Not only this, but Gina also created an AI model of herself to achieve immortality.\n",
      "Response: 1. Review the statement. The provided sentence describes an event – \"Gina created an AI model of herself to achieve immortality\" and does not contain clear emotional overtones or subjective interpretations. However, it's essential to take into consideration other parts of the statement that might seem slightly opinionated.\n",
      "2. Observe the parts of the sentence \"Not only this\" could potentially indicate a slight degree of emphasis or anticipation, making it slightly more subjective compared to simple fact reporting. Nevertheless, the emphasis could still be interpreted as part of the informative context rather than adding personal opinions.\n",
      "3. Consider possible ambiguities, which might affect the classification. The statement doesn't convey any evaluative comments, interpretations, nor speculations that could be labeled as subjective. Also, the lack of emotional language supports the likelihood that it is an objective statement.\n",
      "4. In light of this analysis, I am mostly confident about the proposed answer \"objective\". While there is a trace of some subjective components, they do not significantly alter the statement as a whole from being primarily informative or factual rather than opinionated or subjective. However, if a more explicit subjective context is given, my confidence in this answer may be lowered slightly.\n",

      "Sentence: The valuation is required by law and the figure is assessed independently by a pension specialist and has been reviewed by the National Audit Office.\n",
      "Response: 1. The sentence primarily contains factual claims: The word \"required by law\" indicates a legal context, the mention of \"a pension specialist\" and \"National Audit Office\" establish sources of the valuation, and stating that the figure was assessed and reviewed reinforces the objective nature.\n",
      "2. Objective sentences generally focus on conveying clear, verifiable facts instead of subjective information or opinions.\n",
      "3. Potential ambiguities come from the usage of terms like \"requires by law,\" which in specific circumstances could have subjective interpretation depending on how the law in question is perceived. However, given the context, it is assumed to refer strictly to legal requirements. Similarly, the use of \"independent\" could, in a different context, be interpreted subjectively to imply the assessor’s competency. However, given the specific job titles mentioned, the assumption is made that \"independent\" is referring to the neutral, unbiased nature of the assessment process itself.\n",
      "4. Although not 100% certain, I find it highly probable that the sentence is objective due to the focus on providing essential information about the process through which a valuation was derived. Personal views or biases have not been articulated, and the tone of the sentence remains professional.\n",

      "Response: 1. The sentence does not contain clear objective indicators; however, it is mainly focused on a physical response (a refreshing sip) after performing physical activities. Such information might present as objective.\n",
      "2. Subjectivity may exist but it's implicit: the author can enjoy the cold drink after a workout, or maybe they like the taste better than after a swim. However, neither enjoyment nor taste preference are directly expressed in the sentence. Therefore, the sentence might still be classified as objective based on lack of overt subjective elements.\n",
      "3. Ambiguities might come in if we consider why sipping something can feel so good after exercise - is it because one likes the beverage flavor or is it due to rehydration and cooling? The sentence neither confirms one possibility nor the other. However, such interpretation seems a stretch as the sentence does not imply or invite such an interpretation.\n",
      "4. Although there is some uncertainty about whether the sentence can truly be classified as objective due to potential implicit subjective content, the general emphasis on a physical response to a physical activity can still reasonably fall under an objective categorization given the lack of emotional expressions and unambiguous opinions or evaluations. The implicit subjectivity might not be enough to tilt the balance, especially when it is not apparent to most readers.\n",
      "5. Based on my analysis, I am relatively confident in the classification of the sentence as objective (around 70%) - even though subjective implications may exist subtly and unconsciously, its objective framing is the primary emphasis.\n",

      "Response: 1. This statement contains no explicit emotional, personal, or biased content.\n",
      "2. However, there are edge cases and ambiguities since no factual information, event, or statement is given to evaluate as purely objective:\n",
      "- \"Lobster\" can be an appetizer mentioned in a recipe, which would lean toward being objective\n",
      "- Without additional context, it's also possible that the statement reflects the author's excitement or enthusiasm (e.g., \"Check out that lobster!\") – and thus subjective\n",
      "- Without specific information, one cannot determine whether it represents an objective or subjective perspective\n",
      "3. The lack of context and concrete information makes the classification challenging. There isn't any text provided that could provide insight into author's intent. This makes the classification less secure.\n",
      "4. Due to the multiple potential interpretations of this statement, I am rather unsure about the proposed classification of \"objective\".\n",

      "Response: 1. The given statement doesn't contain typical subjective indicators (no clear first-person perspective, no emotional language, personal feeling, or subjective stance).\n",
      "2. The sentence is conveying reasons based on factual or logical arguments and making an objective claim about a political party's actions (\"must reject\") in response to a given situation.\n",
      "3. An edge case is present because certain adjectives or adverbs might be present that indicate subjectivity (for example: \"obviously,\" \"hopefully,\" \"terribly,\" \"dreadfully\"). However, in this sentence, there are no modifiers like that, so no additional ambiguity exists.\n",
      "4. The confidence level in the proposed answer \"objective\" is moderate because, despite having no subjective linguistic cues, it might still indirectly convey subjective connotations through underlying assumptions, political ideologies, or agendas. Nonetheless, no clear or obvious markers can justify a stronger subjectivity classification.\n",

      "Sentence: Googled how to cook a good lobster and I read how hard it is to get it good because it can turn very tough, rubbery.\n",
      "Response: 1. Initially, the statement seems factual and presents an instruction (\"Googled how to cook a lobster\") and describes a difficulty associated with cooking a lobster correctly (\"can turn very tough, rubbery\"). However, closer analysis reveals that it presents information in an opinionated context because it does not only state a fact (\"hard\" can be a subjective adjective in this case).\n",
      "2. Although the information might appear objective, the subjective aspect arises because the source for this information is Google (implicitly suggesting some level of personal preference) and because 'difficult' and 'tough' can have subjective meanings. Additionally, using the first-person pronoun 'I' subtly implies personal experiences with attempting to cook lobster well.\n",
      "3. A borderline case can be presented considering that the main intention might have been to inform the reader about potential issues with cooking lobster; however, the subjective tone colors the presentation of the information.\n",
      "4. I have a moderate level of uncertainty about the classification because, although it leans toward the subjective end of the spectrum, it does contain factual claims and is a valid piece of information with the intention to enlighten the reader. However, the first-person perspective and the use of emotive terms hint at personal experience and emotion.\n",

      "Sentence: Apartments cost from £392 per week to rent, which makes it more expensive than an average room in first-year halls (a single room without bathroom typically costs £250 per week) but more affordable than a lot of the postgraduate accommodation on offer.\n",
      "Response: 1. The sentence seems to contain a factual claim: \"Apartments cost from £392 per week to rent,\" however it may still reflect some evaluation about comparison of rent amounts (expensive vs. affordable), but it does not contain subjective emotional language or an evaluation based on personal feelings.\n",
      "2. In terms of whether this classification makes sense, while rent costs are an empirical claim, the comparison (expensive vs. affordable) may still be somewhat interpretive or subject to different interpretations. However, within the objective vs. subjective categorization, many comparative analyses, including this one, can still be considered objective, given the lack of clearly personalized and emotional language or author interpretation, instead focusing on factual reporting of information.\n",
      "3. There could be potential borderline ambiguity or interpretation between empirical objective vs. subjective comparison. Nonetheless, given that this is a new article about the comparison of housing costs within the university context, the comparison appears to align more as objective evaluation than subjective author's interpretation or opinion about the subject.\n",
      "4. Confidence remains high because the sentence generally focuses on providing information about the costs (which is empirical), but with slight subjective undertones through the comparison of the different housing options, making the classification a borderline case between fully objective and more subjective.\n",

      "Response: 1. This statement contains less obvious linguistic features; it simply points out an action or lack thereof (\"not approaching it for comment prior to publication\") and an affected party (\"TikTok\"). It's unclear whether these words are conveyed with the author's personal feeling or whether they are presented objectively.\n",
      "2. The proposed answer \"objective\" is reasonable because the sentence mentions the action and does not include explicit emotive language or evaluative judgments about the affected party (TikTok). However, the implied apology (\"We apologise\") has an element of subjectivity, depending on the author's genuine sentiment towards the omitted communication with TikTok.\n",
      "3. There is some uncertainty about the true nature of the statement: it may be presented objectively, highlighting a lack of communication protocol followed, or it could reveal a level of self-criticism or recognition of potential implications in the author's personal view (the implied apology to TikTok).\n",
      "4. I am cautiously confident but not entirely certain, as this classification relies more on interpretation rather than hard facts. Potential subjectivity remains present due to the implied emotion from the apology, making the proposed answer potentially debatable.\n",

      "Sentence: Crumbling parliament patched up with a few fig leaves  Parliament gained some new residents yesterday, and there are already questions as to their expenses.\n",
      "Response: 1. The statement starts with metaphors (\"crumbling\" and \"fig leaves\"), which can indicate subjective perspectives; however, these phrases are colloquial for describing a damaged state of an institution (in this case, the parliament), which is noncontroversial and widely accepted. \"Parliament gained new residents\" and \"questions as to their expenses\" are factual and have verifiable evidence.\n",
      "2. The proposed answer \"objective\" is less obvious for this sentence. The usage of colloquial expressions can imply the author's personal feelings or bias, but the facts presented in the statements seem undisputed and objective (new parliament members, their questions regarding expenses), leaving the ambiguity as to whether the overall statement leans more towards an objective or subjective stance.\n",
      "3. Potential edge cases might include subtler clues the author's personal bias that cannot be definitively identified with just the given information. Examples of bias indicators are words like \"some,\" which may carry a negative tone, as well as the fact that \"questions regarding expenses\" is a politically charged topic that raises further possibilities of subjective interpretation.\n",
      "4. While the factual part of the statement seems objective, the choice of colloquial phrases and topic may introduce a degree of uncertainty in classifying the overall sentence as objective.\n",
